<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>Tidyverse has been around for quite a while, however, it make one common date type unwieldy: matix. Unfortunately, matrix is what many popular times series functionalities packages based on, such as famous <code>xts</code> package. Most promising packages that handle time series in my eyes are <code>tsibble</code> and <code>tidyquant</code>. By no means, there is “use one or the other” relationship between these two packages. Base on the names alone, one can aware of that they have very different goals in minds. <code>tsibble</code> is aiming to come up with general purpose packages that can handle time series while <code>tidyquant</code> has more domain focus on finance, namely, portfolio management.</p>
<p>In this post, I would like to explore these 2 packages w.r.t their overlapped functionalities in order to have a better idea which one would be a better choice for the job.</p>
